# VRBase
This repository contains two Unity projects (one per branch).

1. Base project for building virtual reality applications (master)
2. A game created during the Global Game Jam 2015 (prototype)
 
## VR Base (master branch)
The intent of this repo was to build a base for future Unity projects.
Currently it has a cool 3D mouse pointer, Oculus camera setup, a psychodelic floor (all shader drawing), strange beating heart thing (all shader animation), and laser shots via the mouse with particle effects. It is just a bunch of random effects and bits that may be useful for future games.

## Global Game Jam "Any Questions" (prototype branch)
This is a simple game built for the Oculus Rift, where users stand at a podium and attempt to literally dodge questions being thrown at them from the audience. The only controller is your head. Requires Oculus Rift DK2 and Oculus Runtime 4.4.
